# DSC180-Q2-Project
Abstract: 


## Retrieving the data locally:
(1) Download the data files from the following Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cpUvpXbh3YEHHaW4jmeKhL8DYfE7tE5V?usp=sharing

(2) Place files in `data/raw` directory

## Running the Project:
* To revert to a clean repository, from the project root dir, run `python run.py clean`
  * This deletes all built files
* To run the entire project on test data, from the project root dir, run `python run.py test`
  * This fetches the test data, creates features, cleans the data, and creates machine learning models
  for given disease types
* To run the entire project on the real data, from the project root dir, run `python run.py all`
  * This fetches the original data, creates features, cleans the data, and creates machine learning models
  for given disease types
